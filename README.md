# CryoMeasure Hardware
A resistance vs temperature measurement system based on a [] cryostat we had lying around.
<br>
The goal was to have the ability to counduct a basic preliminary measurement before using our more capble (but much more occupied) [ppms](https://www.qdusa.com/products/dynacool.html) system.<br>
The first priority was measureing PLD/sputtering grown thin films, but also to have the option to work with other kind of samples.
